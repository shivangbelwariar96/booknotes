# Database Server Capacity & Requirements (Updated)

| Component                       | Estimate             | How It’s Calculated |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Peak QPS (Queries Per Second)** | ~50,000 QPS per DB server | Distributed across many servers. A realistic load per server for large-scale production workloads like Google Drive |
| **Total QPS for Google Drive**   | ~500K - 1M QPS       | The total load across the entire system, distributed across 100-200 servers |
| **Database Servers**             | ~200-250 servers     | Total DB servers, with 50K QPS per server for read-heavy workloads (e.g., metadata access, file syncing) |
| **Database Type**                | NoSQL / Distributed DB | Likely using Bigtable or Spanner for scalability and low-latency access |
| **Database Sharding**            | Yes (Horizontal Scaling) | Data is sharded and distributed across multiple servers to balance load and optimize read/write operations |
| **Storage for Files (Metadata)** | ~200 PB              | Metadata storage across distributed file systems and relational DBs (to handle file properties, user data) |

# Caching Layer (Redis, Memcached)

| Cache Type                     | Size                | How It’s Used |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **User File Cache**             | ~50 PB              | Cache frequently accessed user files for faster retrieval and low-latency responses |
| **Metadata Cache**              | ~5-10 PB            | Cache of metadata for faster lookups (e.g., file names, sizes, user permissions) |
| **Cache Expiry (TTL)**          | 1-5 minutes         | Most data is short-lived in cache and frequently updated, TTL varies based on file activity |

# Network Infrastructure

| Metric                         | Estimate             | How It’s Calculated |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Total Network Throughput**    | ~30 Tbps             | Total traffic across Google’s global network serving data to users (uploads/downloads) |
| **Total Data Served/Day**       | ~100+ PB            | Data transferred to/from users for syncing files, uploading, and downloads |
| **Edge Data Centers**           | ~20+ globally       | Data centers across the globe to serve low-latency file access and sync |
| **CDN Servers**                 | ~10,000+            | Content Delivery Network (CDN) servers to cache and deliver frequently accessed files |

# Energy & Cost Estimates

| Cost Category                   | Annual Estimate      | How It’s Calculated |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Compute Costs (Cloud Equivalent)** | $1.5-2 billion    | Based on cloud instance costs for compute-intensive services like file indexing, AI, and file sync operations |
| **Storage Costs (S3/EBS Equivalent)** | $500-700 million  | S3/EBS storage pricing, factoring in data redundancy (RAID) and geographic distribution |
| **Network Costs**               | $300-400 million     | Based on global network traffic costs (data transferred across regions) |
| **Total Annual Cost**           | $2.5-3 billion       | Total operational cost, combining compute, storage, and network |
