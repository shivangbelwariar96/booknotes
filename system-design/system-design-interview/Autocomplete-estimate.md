|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Total Users**                 | ~5 billion         | Estimated based on global internet users (Statista, ITU reports) |
| **Daily Active Users (DAU)**     | ~3 billion         | ~60% of total users (Not all users search daily) |
| **Avg. Search Queries/User/Day** | 3-4                | Industry estimate from SEO blogs, Google stats |
| **Total Search Queries/Day**     | ~8.5 billion       | **DAU × Avg. Queries/User** → `3B × 3 = 8.5B` |
| **Avg. Query Response Size**     | 500 bytes          | Estimated JSON response size per autocomplete API call |
| **Total Data Served/Day**        | ~4.25 PB           | **Total Queries × Avg. Response Size** → `8.5B × 500B = 4.25PB` |
| **Autocomplete Cache Hit Rate**  | 95%               | Assumption based on caching efficiency at Google scale |
| **Queries Hitting DB/Day**       | ~425 million      | **Total Queries × (1 - Cache Hit Rate)** → `8.5B × 5% = 425M` |
| **Unique Search Queries/Day**    | 15% of total queries | Industry estimate (~85% of queries are repeated) |
| **Index Growth/Day**             | ~200 GB           | **Unique queries stored for future lookups** (~2 KB per entry) |

# Compute and Memory Requirements

| Component                       | Value             | Formula / Assumption |
|---------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Peak QPS (Queries Per Second)** | ~99,000         | **Total Queries/Day ÷ 86,400 sec** → `8.5B ÷ 86,400 = 99K` |
| **Avg. Response Time**          | <200ms           | Industry benchmark for fast search engines |
| **Cache Size (Redis/Memcached)** | ~2 PB           | Caches top 95% queries for instant retrieval |
| **Database Servers**            | ~20,000         | Each DB server handles ~50K uncached queries/sec |
| **App Servers for Query Processing** | ~50,000  | Each server handles ~10K queries/sec |
| **Total Network Bandwidth**     | ~394 Gbps       | **Total Data Served/Day ÷ 86,400 sec × 8** → `(4.25PB ÷ 86,400) × 8` |

# Storage and Indexing Considerations

| Storage Type                     | Capacity        | Formula / Assumption |
|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Hot Storage (SSDs, NVMe)**     | ~1 PB         | Frequently accessed indexes (~20% of total index) |
| **Warm Storage (HDDs, Object Storage)** | ~2 PB  | Less-frequently accessed queries (~40% of index) |
| **Cold Storage (Archived Data)** | ~10 PB        | Older logs for analytics |

### **Indexing Mechanism**
- **Trie-based prefix matching** (Fast lookup of autocomplete terms)  
- **Inverted Index** (High-speed searching)  
- **Distributed search clusters** (Google Spanner for scalability)

# Caching Layer (Redis, Memcached, CDNs)

| Cache Type                     | Capacity       | Formula / Assumption |
|--------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Search Query Cache**         | ~1 PB        | Caches frequent queries for instant response |
| **User History Cache**         | ~500 TB      | Personal search history for personalization |
| **Cache Expiry (TTL)**         | 1-10 minutes | Frequent updates needed to adapt to trends |

### **Cache Strategy**
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)** for general queries  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** for trending queries

# Backend Processing and Machine Learning Requirements

| Component                        | Capacity       | Formula / Assumption |
|---------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Query Ranking Workers**       | ~50,000      | **ML-based ranking** (1 worker per 2K queries/sec) |
| **Personalized Suggestions ML** | ~25,000 TPUs | AI-powered autocomplete ranking |
| **Real-time Trending Query Processors** | ~20,000  | Detects & updates hot queries dynamically |
| **NLP & Spelling Correction Models** | ~10,000 TPUs | AI-driven typo correction |

### **ML Model Considerations**
- **BERT-based ranking** (Natural language understanding)  
- **Personalization** (Past searches, preferences)  
- **Real-time trends** (Dynamic updates based on events)

# Network & Infrastructure Requirements

| Infrastructure            | Capacity       | Formula / Assumption |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Total Network Throughput** | ~394 Gbps   | **Total Data Served/Day ÷ 86,400 sec × 8** |
| **Number of Data Centers**   | 30+         | Google’s global redundancy |
| **Edge CDN Servers**         | ~20,000     | Reduces latency by caching regional searches |
